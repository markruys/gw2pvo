# gw2pvo

gw2pvo is a command line tool to upload solar data from a GoodWe power inverter to the PVOutput.org website.

## Installation

You need to have Python 3 and pip installed. Then:

    sudo pip3 install https://github.com/markruys/gw2pvo/releases/download/1.2.1/gw2pvo-1.2.1.tar.gz

Next determine the Station ID from the GoodWe site as follows. Open the [Sems Portal](https://www.semsportal.com). The Plant Status will reveal the Station ID in the URL. Example:

    https://www.semsportal.com/powerstation/powerstatussnmin/9a6415bf-cdcc-46af-b393-2b442fa89a7f

Then the Station ID is `9a6415bf-cdcc-46af-b393-2b442fa89a7f`.

Furthermore, you need a (free) [PVOutput](PVOutput.org) account. Register a device and enable the API. From PVOutput you need:

  1. The API Key
  2. The System Id of your device

Optionally, for actual weather information you can get a (free) [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) account. Register and get 1,000 free calls per day. From DarkSky you need:

  1. Secret API Key

## Usage

```
usage: gw2pvo [-h] --gw-station-id ID --gw-account ACCOUNT --gw-password
                   PASSWORD --pvo-system-id ID --pvo-api-key KEY
                   [--pvo-interval {5,10,15}]
                   [--darksky-api-key DARKSKY_API_KEY]
                   [--log {debug,info,warning,critical}] [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
                   [--pv-voltage] [--skip-offline] [--city CITY] [--csv CSV] [--version]

Upload GoodWe power inverter data to PVOutput.org

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --gw-station-id ID    GoodWe station ID
  --gw-account ACCOUNT  GoodWe account
  --gw-password PASSWORD
                        GoodWe password
  --pvo-system-id ID    PVOutput system ID
  --pvo-api-key KEY     PVOutput API key
  --pvo-interval {5,10,15}
                        PVOutput interval in minutes
  --darksky-api-key DARKSKY_API_KEY
                        Dark Sky Weather API key
  --log {debug,info,warning,critical}
                        Set log level (default info)
  --date YYYY-MM-DD     Copy all readings (max 14/90 days ago)
  --pv-voltage		Send pv voltage instead of grid voltage
  --skip-offline        Skip uploads when inverter is offline
  --city CITY           Skip uploads from dusk till dawn
  --csv CSV             Append readings to a Excel compatible CSV file, DATE
                        in the name will be replaced by the current date
  --version             show program's version number and exit
```

### Examples

```
gw2pvo --gw-station-id GWID --gw-account ACCOUNT --gw-password PASSWORD --pvo-system-id PVOID --pvo-api-key KEY --log debug
```

If you want to save readings in a daily CSV file:

```
gw2pvo --gw-station-id GWID --gw-account ACCOUNT --gw-password PASSWORD --pvo-system-id PVOID --pvo-api-key KEY --csv "Solar DATE.csv"
```

Off course replace GWID, ACCOUNT, PVOID, PASSWORD, and KEY for the proper values. DATE will be automatically substituted by the current date.

## Automatic uploads

The power graph on PVOutput is not based on the power reading from GoodWe, but on the amount of energy produced this day. This has the advantage that it does not matter if you skip one or more readings.

PVOutput gives you the option to choose to upload each 5, 10, or 15 minutes. Make sure you upload at the same rate as configured at PVOutput.

The inverter updates goodwe-power.com each 8 minutes. The API gives resolution for produced energy of only 0.1 kWh. So for a 5 minute interval we get a resolution of 1200 watt, which is pretty big. To get smooth PVOutput graphs, we apply a running average which depends on the configured PVOutput upload interval time.

### Systemd service

If you run gw2pvo on a Systemd based Linux, you could install the script as a service, like:

```
[Unit]
Description=Read GoodWe inverter and upload data to PVOutput.org

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/gw2pvo
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/gw2pvo --gw-station-id GWID --gw-account ACCOUNT --gw-password PASSWORD --pvo-system-id PVOID --pvo-api-key KEY --pvo-interval 5
Restart=always
RestartSec=300
User=gw2pvo
Environment="TZ=Etc/UTC"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Make sure you set your Timezone (the TZ line) to the appropriate setting for your locale. A list is typically located in `/usr/share/zoneinfo/`.

Store the file as ``/etc/systemd/system/gw2pvo.service`` and run:

    sudo useradd -m gw2pvo
    sudo systemctl enable gw2pvo
    sudo systemctl start gw2pvo
    sudo systemctl status gw2pvo
    sudo journalctl -u gw2pvo -f

## Recover missed data

You can copy a day of readings from GoodWe to PVOutput. Interval will be 10 minutes as this is what the API provides. Syntax:

```
gw2pvo --gw-station-id GWID --gw-account ACCOUNT --gw-password PASSWORD --pvo-system-id PVOID --pvo-api-key KEY --date YYYY-MM-DD
```

Beware that the date parameter must be not be older than 14 days from the current date. In donation mode, not more than 90 days.

## Docker

MichaÃ«l Hompus created a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/energy164/gw2pvo/) ([Github](https://github.com/eNeRGy164/gw2pvo-docker)) to run gw2pvo.

## Disclaimer

GoodWe access is based on the undocumented API used by mobile apps. It could be very well that at a certain point GoodWe decides to alter or disable the API.
